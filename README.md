Well it is just a tool to calculate functional dependecy. In the day I was calculating a dependecy, I found out that it is too hard to find all. So I decided to write a program for this work. I found 250+ dependecy!!! So I wrote all of them. However, the next day, my teaching assistant said, only some is enough. What a fuck day.
